________________________________________
Explanation:
1.	Maze Representation:
o	The maze is represented as a 2D NumPy array where 0 indicates free space and 1 indicates walls.
2.	A Algorithm*:
o	The algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) to explore nodes with the lowest cost (f = g + h).
o	g: Cost from the start node to the current node.
o	h: Heuristic cost (Manhattan distance) from the current node to the goal.
3.	Visualization:
o	The maze and the path are visualized using Matplotlib. The path is drawn in red.
4.	Input/Output:
o	The program starts at (0, 0) and tries to reach (4, 4).
o	If a path is found, it is printed and visualized. Otherwise, it reports that no path exists.

Example Run:
Input Maze:
0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
Output:
Path found: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]
Visualization:
•	The path is shown in red over the maze.
This program is modular and can be extended to handle larger mazes or different movement rules.
